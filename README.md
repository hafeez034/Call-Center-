# Call-Center PowerBI DashBoard:

1. Total Calls and Unanswered Percentage:
   - Out of 5000 total calls, 946 were unanswered, which is 18.92% of the total.
   - This indicates that nearly 1 in 5 calls are going unanswered, which could suggest a need to focus on improving call handling or availability.

2. Average Talk Duration and Satisfaction:
   - The average talk duration is 3.25 minutes, and the average satisfaction score is 3.40.
   - This suggests a reasonable balance between the duration of conversations and customer satisfaction, though there might still be room for improvement, especially in unresolved topics.

3. Answered vs. Unanswered Calls by Topic:
   -   Payment-related issues have the highest number of unanswered calls, indicating this might be an area where improvements in responsiveness or resource allocation could be needed.
   - Technical Support also has a high number of both answered and unanswered calls, which could indicate a high volume of technical issues overall.

4. Not Resolved Topics:
   - The "Not Resolved by Topic" chart shows that the highest number of unresolved issues is in Payment-related topics, followed by Contract-related issues.
   - This suggests that these two areas need further investigation to identify why issues are not being resolved and how to address the root causes.

5. Rating of 4 & 5 by Topic:
   - Payment-related and Technical Support topics received relatively low satisfaction ratings compared to other topics like Admin Support and Contract-related topics.
   - Improving the handling of payment-related and technical issues might lead to higher customer satisfaction.

6. Average Talk Duration vs. 4 & 5 Ratings by Topic:
   - Technical Support has both a relatively high average talk duration and a low satisfaction rating (4 & 5 ratings).
   - This could indicate that while technical issues require longer time to address, they are not necessarily being resolved to the customer’s satisfaction, highlighting a possible need for better training or resources in this area.

7. Count of Answered Calls by Agent:
   - Joe and Stewart appear to handle the fewest calls, while Jim and Martha handle the most.
   - There might be uneven distribution of call handling among agents, or Joe and Stewart might require additional support or training to increase their effectiveness.

 Overall Recommendations:
- Focus on Payment and Technical Support: These two areas show high unresolved rates and low satisfaction, which suggests a need to optimize resources or strategies for handling these types of calls.
- Improve Unanswered Call Rate: With almost 19% unanswered calls, there’s an opportunity to improve efficiency, either by adjusting staffing levels or addressing reasons for missed calls.
- Balance Agent Workload: There is an opportunity to ensure that call handling responsibilities are more evenly distributed among agents, especially for those with fewer answered calls.
